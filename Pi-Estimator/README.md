A fun challenge involving mathematics. Very creative.

The following are example plots of how the value was calculated.

## Plot 1: N = 10
Estimated value of pi = 2.8
![n is 10](./Figure_1.png)

## Plot 2: N = 100
Estimated value of pi = 2.96
![n is 100](./Figure_2.png)

## Plot 3: N = 1000
Estimated value of pi = 3.1
![n is 1000](./Figure_3.png)

## Plot 4: N = 10000
Estimated value of pi = 3.15
![n is 1000](./Figure_4.png)

## Plot 5: N = 100000
Estimated value of pi = 3.14192
![n is 1000](./Figure_5.png)
