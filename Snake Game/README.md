A classic game we all love to play! The user uses their arrow keys to control a snake as it makes its way through obstacles to eat as much food as possible.

The rules of the game are simple:

1. You grow by 1 block when you eat a red block.
2. A number of additional yellow blocks will emerge each time you consume a red block.
3. Hitting a yellow block results to a loss.
4. You control the direction of the snake's movement.
Good Luck!

P.S. I got the idea to make this version thanks to Al Sweigart(al@inventwithpython.com). I also used snippets of his code from the game found here: http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter6.html#
