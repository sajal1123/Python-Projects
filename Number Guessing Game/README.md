This is a python based game. The computer will pick a random number from a pre-defined range based on the difficulty selected by the user. An increment of 1 in the difficulty level increases the range by a factor of 10.
The aim of the game is to guess the number in as few tries as possible. After each guess by the player, the game will tell the player whether their guess was higher or lower than the target. This game illustrates the efficiency of the **Binary Search** algorithm.

Have fun!
