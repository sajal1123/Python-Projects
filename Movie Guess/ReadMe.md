A text-based movie guessing game where the player must guess the name of a movie - one letter at a time.

This is a fun single-player game. The movie names are taken from the IMDB dataset consisting of the best movies of all time. In total, the database contains 246 movies.

Rules:

1. Your aim is to guess the full name of the movie in as few attempts as possible.
2. In one turn, you can input and lower-case letter or a number as your guess.
3. Each letter in the name of the movie is represented by an underscore symbol(_), and the spaces between words are represented by a forward slash(/).
4. You may quit the game at any point by typing the word 'quit' as your input.
5. When you correctly guess the name of the movie, you will be given a score out of 100 based on the number of guesses it took you to guess the full name correctly.

Have fun!
